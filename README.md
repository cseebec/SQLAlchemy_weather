## Introduction 
In this repo I used SQLAlchemy in python to query and analyze climate data more specifically temperature and precipitation data in Hawaii. (Note the data used for this repo is not up to date it is from a csv file)

## System Requirements
- Microsoft Excel
- SQLite
- Jupyter Lab
- Python (version 3 or later needed for .py files)

### Python Dependencies Required
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- datetime
- dateutil
- sqlalchemy
- flask

To install these libraries all you have to do is go into Git Bash (or whatever operating system you choose to use) and execute the command:
"pip install <.Library name.>", so for example "pip install matplotlib"

## Data Analysis
### Climate_starter.ipynb
Overall the jupyter lab file utilizes SQLAlchemy to analyze on the datasets. Some of the results found include: a summary table of precipitation (in inches) during the last year recorded in the dataset and the maximum, minimum, and average temperature of the most active station.
